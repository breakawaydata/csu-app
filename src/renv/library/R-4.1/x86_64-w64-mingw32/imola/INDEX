                        functions.
applyTemplate           Merges a set of attributes with a given
                        template. To avoid redundanct attributes being
                        added to the final list, a list of default
                        values (based of the specific panel creation
                        callback formals) is used to validate the need

                        given grid type. Templates are collections of
                        arguments that can be grouped and stored for
                        later usage via the "template" argument of
                        panel and page functions.

                        for a css media query. Used internally to
                        generate a breakpoint specific wrapper.
normalizeAttribute      Converts non named list attributes into a named
                        list. Does nothing if the attribute is already
                        a list in the correct format.

                        full attribute list.
processContent          Adds a css class to any HTML elements from the
                        content that are named and which name is in the
                        areas vector for names. This allows content to
                        be assigned to the grid areas via named
                        argument while still allowing other generic

                        the package directory.
registerBreakpoint      Adds a new breakpoint entry to the currelty

                        Depending on the given type, the template will
                        then be available to be passed as an argument
                        to a panel or page function of that specific
                        type. Templates are collections of arguments
                        that can be grouped and stored for later usage
                        via the "template" argument of panel and page
                        functions.
setBreakpointSystem     Sets the current active media breakpoints. By
                        default the default_system setting values are
                        used, but the list can be customized by using
                        the registerBreakpoint() and
                        unregisterBreakpoint() functions.
stringCSSRule           Applies a CSS statement template stored in the
                        package settings. These templates use the
                        htmlTemplate format, meaning placeholders are
                        marked using the placeholder convention.  Each
                        placeholder value should be passed as a named
                        argument to the function using the placeholder
                        value as a name.  Used primarily as a shorthand
                        to stringTemplate() for stored templates.
stringTemplate          Processes a string template in the htmlTemplate
                        format into a valid string with no
                        placeholders. The string must use the
                        htmlTemplate format, meaning placeholders are
                        marked using the placeholder convention.
unregisterBreakpoint    Allows removing an entry from the current
                        activeBreakpoints.
unregisterTemplate      Deletes an existing css template from the
                        available list of templates for the given grid
                        type. Templates are collections of arguments
                        that can be grouped and stored for later usage
                        via the "template" argument of panel and page
                        functions.
valueToCSS              Converts a R List or vector object into a valid
                        css string. Used primarily to convert
                        normalized attribute values into css values
                        during processing.
